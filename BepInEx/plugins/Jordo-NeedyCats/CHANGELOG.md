## v1.2.0
- Added cat food! It can be purchased for 5 credits at the terminal and, if open and on the ground, will feed any number of cats within a few meters for 12 hours! It has two possible effects, selectable in the mod's config:
	- Delay the cats meows by a *substantial amount*, default, recommended for multiplayer as you'll still need someone to pet them regularly
	- Silence the cats meows for the entire 12 hours duration, recommended for solo play
- Added a chance for the cats to flee if being attacked by dogs, the percentage of chance is by default 10% every 2.5 seconds, you can configure the chance percentage in the mod's config.
- Slightly buffed the decorations meow timer bonus
- Cats no longer flee from boomboxes or the dropship
- Cats will now meow faster if they were just fleeing
- Fixed a bug where cats wouldn't refresh the AI nodes on level load (caused issues with the fleeing behaviour)
- Fixed cats not appearing on LLL custom moons
- Fixed cats SFX not having correct audio mixer
